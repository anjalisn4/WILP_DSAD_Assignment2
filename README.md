Manipal hospital and the Bangalore traffic police are working together on a critical mission:
to deliver a heart required for a transplant from the Hospital to the airport. From there it will
be flown to Chennai where the recipient patient is being prepped for the surgery.
Given the urgency and criticality of this mission, the Bangalore traffic police has agreed to
set up a traffic free and signal free corridor for the ambulance carrying the organ to reach the
airport in the quickest possible time. The police IT department has a layout of the Bangalore
map with roads and junctions / signals between the hospital and the airport. (the length in
kilometres of the road is indicated by the weightage of each connecting line and the junction
/ signal is indicated by the nodes). Now they need your help in finding the best possible route
with the shortest distance that the ambulance should use.
